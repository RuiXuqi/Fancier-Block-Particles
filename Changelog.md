## [Unreleased] Fancier Block Particles Version 0.8 Changelog

### Highlights

#### Revamped configs!

The new configs are easier to read understand and use, they are also faster which makes FBP have nearly no impact on loading times.

***Old Configs will be deleted so please back them up before launching if you have made major changes to them***

#### Revamped GUI

Enjoy easier to use GUI as well as a new beautiful background, this applies to every GUI in FBP.
Also take a look into the new settings page, which allows you to turn on things like debug mode and experiments, which is a new menu for experimental features.

![New gui](https://github.com/Red-Studio-Ragnarok/Fancier-Block-Particles/assets/82710983/612b4e65-ddaf-4a67-8620-d2351f9c52c3)
